ExpopseNet: A Dark Web Threat Hunting Application
Overview
ExpopseNet is a Dark Web Threat Hunting Application designed to help organizations proactively identify and mitigate potential security threats originating from the dark web. This project automates the process of searching, collecting, and analyzing data from various dark web sources to provide actionable threat intelligence.

Features:
Automated Web Scraping: Efficiently navigates and collects data from interconnected dark web pages.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Processes and filters the collected data for specific cybersecurity terms to identify relevant threats.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): User-friendly interface designed with Figma and implemented using Tkinter for easy interaction with the application.
Threat Intelligence News Feed: Displays the latest threat intelligence to keep users informed.
Future Enhancements: User authentication and authorization, real-time alerting system, advanced search capabilities, and data visualization features.



Installation
Clone the repository:
->git clone https://github.com/HanyaNagib/ExposeNet.git
->cd ExposeNet

Set up the virtual environment and VPN for dark web access:
Install Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager.
Set up an Ubuntu VM and install the TOR browser.
Use PlanetVPN to change your location for secure dark web access.



Usage:
Web Scraping Module:
The web scraping module uses Python scripts to navigate and collect data from dark web pages.
Run the web scraping script:
->python crawler.py <start_url>

NLP Module:
The NLP module processes the text data collected by the web scraper, filtering it for cybersecurity terms.
Run the NLP script:
->python nlp.py

Graphical User Interface (GUI):
The GUI allows users to interact with the application, search for specific cybersecurity terms, and view the latest threat intelligence.
Run the GUI application:
->python homepage.py


Future Work
Robust Database Solution: Transitioning from text file-based storage to a relational or NoSQL database for better scalability and performance.
User Authentication and Authorization: Implementing secure access control mechanisms.
Real-Time Alerting System: Notifying users of critical threats in real-time.
Advanced Search Capabilities: Adding features like keyword suggestions and filtering options.
Data Visualization: Incorporating charts and graphs for better data analysis.
Integration with Other Security Tools: Enhancing utility and effectiveness by integrating with existing security platforms.
Machine Learning Integration: Utilizing machine learning models for more accurate threat detection and analysis.
